my super fire thesis

Python Simulator:
1. There is Host.py and Sentry.py, whose semantics are defined by paper
2. Commands.py outlines commands for both machines, as significant overlap
3. Trace values are sent from Host to Sentry via trace.json
4. The Simulator.py is the main file to run; Here, the program is defined, and Host and Sentry and properly called.
