1. High level - Am I implementing these three pieces in Agda
2. Does putting this in Agda 'prove it truly works' because Agda type checks 
    How is it deterministic
    Soundness vs completeness
    Am I making a type system?


3. What is Clements talking about for indexing a set of instructions
4. 530 - We made a language



Not type checking. BIg pic - running machine and seeing if same states at the end/in sync?
    Only host and sentry 
    Start with arithmetic
    than try either memory or control flow
    Use python - depending on put pc, do the proper step
